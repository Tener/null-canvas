null-canvas is as fork of blank-canvas with some changes 
to make it more configurable and composable with other software.

The name has been changed to avoid confusion within .cabal files.
-------------------------------------------------------
blank-canvas is a Haskell port of the HTML5 Canvas API.
Tutorials and examples for the HTML5 for the HTML5 Canvas
should be trivial to port to this library.

blank-canvas works by providing a web service, that
displays the users' Haskell commands inside a browser.

There are several examples inside the 'examples' directory.

Enjoy!
